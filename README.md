## How to run

- Make sure you have `node` installed
- Then, run:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
- You should be good to go! So:
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

## Considerations

Since JS does not have a native `Heap` class implementation, I resourced the library [`heap`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/heap) which seems to be frequently used, so this is the only library that was added to the boilerplate repo.
